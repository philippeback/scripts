<h2 id="">Problem</h2>

<p>You use the Git version control system with Vim and want shortcuts for
common operations and syntax highlighting for <tt>git</tt> output.</p>

<h2 id="">Solution</h2>

<p>Thanks to the work of <a href="http://www.tpope.net/">Tim Pope</a> and
others, Vim ships with syntax highlighting support for Git output/templates.
For example, after executing <tt>git commit -a</tt>, with Vim set as your
default editor, you'll see

<img src="../../vim-git-commit.png" />

</p><p>Vim can even help you write better commit messages. Git commit messages
should typically have a 50-character or less summary as their first line, with
a blank second line, then, optionally a long explanation, wrapped at about 72
characters<span class="fn">For an explanation
  of this convention see <a href="http://www.tpope.net/node/106">A Note About
    Git Commit Messages</a>.</span>. There's no need to remember this
convention, however, because Vim warns you, visually, if you colour outside
the lines. For example:</p>

<img src="../../vim-git-commit-highlighting.png" />

<p>In this example, the first line is too long, so the extraneous characters
are coloured black. The second line should be blank, so it has a red
background to indicate its contents are in error.</p>

<p><a href="http://subtech.g.hatena.ne.jp/motemen/"><i>motemen</i></a>'s <a href="http://github.com/motemen/git-vim"><i>git-vim</i></a> plugin extends
this support by adding shortcuts and commands for common Git operations.</p>

<p>Install it by copying its files to your Vim directory. For example, on
Linux:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/.vim
cd /tmp
git clone git://github.com/motemen/git-vim.git
cp -r git-vim/{plugin,syntax} ~/.vim/
cd -</code></pre>

<p>You now have access to commands such as <tt>:GitCommit</tt>, which will,
split your window horizontally, loading the Git commit template into the upper
pane. Once you have written your commit message and quit the buffer, your file
will be committed. (This assumes, of course, that the current file is located
in a Git working directory).</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p><i>Bob Hiestand</i>'s <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=90"><tt>vcscommand</tt></a>
  plugin offers similar functionality to <tt>git-vim</tt>, but it also
  supports <abbr title="Concurrent Versions Systems">CVS</abbr>, <abbr title="Subversion">SVN</abbr>, and SVK. This makes it especially suitable
  for situations where one uses multiple version control systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="">Discussion</h2>

<p>Through a combination of editable history and particularly fast operation,
Git invites regular commits. This is only feasible, however, if Git is tightly
integrated into Vim, because otherwise version control will become a source of
distraction that steals your focus and wastes your time.</p>

<p>Vim's ability to <a href="../../editing/executing-external-commands/index.html">execute external
  commands</a> already makes using <tt>git</tt> reasonably straightforward.
For instance, <tt>:!git add %</tt> would add the current file, while <tt>:!git
  log</tt> would temporarily suspend Vim to show you the commit log.</p>

<p>The <i>git-vim</i> plugin expedites this process by providing Normal mode
shortcuts. <kbd>\ga</kbd><span class="fn">This example and those following
  assume that your <tt>Leader</tt> variable is set to the default of
  <tt>/</tt>; see <tt>:help leader</tt> for details.</span> adds the current
file, <kbd>\gc</kbd> commits it, etc.<span class="fn">For a complete list of
  shortcuts offered by this plugin see its <tt>README.rdoc</tt>
  file.</span></p>

<p><i>git-vim</i> takes this integration further for commands like
<tt>:GitBlame</tt> where the window is split vertically to show the author's
name alongside the lines he was responsible for. </p>

<img src="../../vim-git-blame.png" />

<p>This presentation is clearly superior to the output of <tt>:!git blame
  %</tt>, shown below, in that it employs syntax highlighting, allows inline
editing, and hides extraneous output.</p>
