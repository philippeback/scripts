  Shortcuts with Key Mappings</h1>

<h2 id="">Problem</h2>

<p>You'd like to execute a command, or series thereof, with a keyboard
shortcut rather than continually type it in. Or, you'd like to change an
existing keyboard shortcut so that it does something more useful.</p>

<p>For example, you use the <kbd>&lt;Space&gt;</kbd> key to page down in other
applications, and you'd like to do the same in Vim. Or, you regularly reformat
paragraphs with <kbd>gqap</kbd>, but would prefer to simply hit
<kbd>Q</kbd>.</p>

<h2 id="">Solution</h2>

<p>Use <i>key mappings</i>. A map is simply a key combination followed by
another key combination. When you enter the first key combination Vim acts as
if you entered the second.</p>

<p>For example, to remap <kbd>&lt;Space&gt;</kbd> to
<kbd>&lt;PageDown&gt;</kbd> you execute <tt>:map &lt;Space&gt;
  &lt;PageDown&gt;</tt>. The <tt>map</tt> command creates a mapping for
<i>Normal</i>, <i>Visual</i>, and <i>Operator
  Pending</i> mode; i.e. if you press <kbd>&lt;Space&gt;</kbd> in
<i>Insert</i> mode this mapping, thankfully, has no effect.</p>

<p>Mapping <kbd>Q</kbd> to <kbd>gqap</kbd> is similarly straight forward:
<tt>:nmap Q gqap</tt>. Unlike <tt>map</tt>, <tt>:nmap</tt> only takes effect
in Normal mode. We used <tt>nmap</tt> here because this mapping doesn't make
sense in other modes: in Insert mode we want <kbd>Q</kbd> to insert a literal
<i>Q</i>, and in Visual mode we want to reformat the selected text rather than
the current paragraph. The Visual mode mapping is <tt>:vmap Q gq</tt>.</p>

<p>The other main types of mapping commands are:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>:imap</tt></dt>
  <dd>Insert mode only.</dd>
  <dt><tt>:cmap</tt></dt>
  <dd>Command-line only.</dd>
  <dt><tt>:map</tt></dt>
  <dd>Normal, Visual, and Operator-pending.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="">Discussion</h2>

<p>Keyboard mapping is yet another way to save valuable keystrokes. If you
find yourself executing a command repeatedly create a mapping. It's also
useful for creating more sensible aliases for existing keyboard shortcuts that
you can never quite remember.</p>

<p>It's generally recommended to map the function keys
(<kbd>&lt;F1&gt;</kbd>-<kbd>&lt;F12&gt;</kbd>), as well as their shifted
counterparts (e.g.  <kbd><kbd>&lt;Shift&gt;</kbd>-<kbd>&lt;F3&gt;</kbd></kbd>)
because they're not used by Vim<span class="fn"><kbd>&lt;F1&gt;</kbd>
  <i>is</i> used for <tt>:help</tt> but pretty useless given that you'd
  normally use <tt>:help <var>topic</var></tt>.</span>. As long as you use a
combination that doesn't interfere with the commands you do use, you're free
to use whatever you want, though.</p>

<p>Before you create a mapping you might like to check what, if anything, it's
currently being used for. You can do this by executing <tt>:help
  <var>key</var></tt>, e.g. <tt>:help &lt;F1&gt;</tt> will show that Vim maps
it to <tt>:help</tt>. If you want to see the user-defined mappings (whether
set by you or a plugin) call the <tt>:map</tt> command with no arguments. This
works will the mode-specific map commands outlined above, too, so
<tt>:imap</tt> will show Insert mode mappings.</p>
