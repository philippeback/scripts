<h2 id="">Problem</h2>

<p>Your file contains lines which are too long to fit on the screen. You find
it hard to edit and view.</p>

<h2 id="">Solution</h2>

<p>The <tt>:set wrap</tt> command, which should be on by default, changes how
long lines are displayed. Once they reach the right margin they are broken,
and continued on the line below. (To disable this behaviour: <tt>:set
  nowrap</tt>).</p>

<p><tt>wrap</tt> only changes the way the lines are displayed, however; the
file will not be changed. It inserts <i>soft</i> line breaks.</p>

<p>This means that a file containing two particularly long lines may be
represented by Vim as having 5 lines, for example, after wrapping. If you try
to navigate this file using the <a href="../../basics/basic-navigation/index.html">basic movement
  commands</a> <kbd>j</kbd> would move between the two logical lines, rather
than the <i>screen lines</i>. The solution is to prefix the movement commands
with <kbd>g</kbd>, so <kbd>gj</kbd> moves down one screen line.</p>

<p>If using <tt>wrap</tt>, you can specify what point the line should be
broken by executing <tt>:set linebreak</tt>. This uses the value of
<tt>breakat</tt> to decide where to break the line. To change the characters
used modify <tt>breakat</tt>.</p>

<p>You can use <tt>:set textwidth=<var>width</var></tt> to enforce a maximum
line length, after which the text is broken with a "hard" line break. Vim
breaks at white space, so lines may be shorter than <tt>width</tt>. To
reformat existing text according to this preference either select them
visually and hit <kbd>gq</kbd> or, in <i>Normal</i> mode, you can reformat the
current paragraph with <kbd>gqap</kbd>.</p>

<h2 id="">Discussion</h2>

<p>In general, you'll be better off using <i>hard</i> line breaks with
<i>textwidth</i>. This removes the need to differentiate between logical lines
and screen lines, and means that the file will display reasonably in any
editor, even if it doesn't wrap long lines.</p>

<p>Traditionally, text file lines are kept under 80 characters.  This is
mainly a holdover from the days of terminals whose displays were limited in
this way, but is still customary in many programming languages and e-mail. To
enforce this restriction just <tt>:set textwidth=80</tt>.</p>

<p>There's another way to insert hard line breaks without specifying a maximum
line length. It is called <tt>wrapmargin</tt> and wraps lines relative to the
width of the terminal window. For example, <tt>:set wrapmargin=4</tt> means
that when a line is more than four characters away from the right-hand margin,
it is broken. This approach is more flexible than <tt>textwidth</tt>, but has
the disadvantage of producing files which will display poorly on smaller
displays or when the screen is split between multiple files.  Especially if
you're sharing the files you produce with others, I suggest the use of
<tt>textwidth</tt> instead.</p>

<blockquote class="tip"> 
    <p><tt>textwidth</tt> takes precedence over <tt>wrapmargin</tt>.  For
    <tt>wrapmargin</tt> to take effect <tt>textwidth</tt> must be zero, as it
    is by default.</p>
