<h2 id="">Problem</h2>

<p>You want to create an <i>outline view</i> of a document such that its
structure can be treated as a hierarchy, the levels of which can be expanded
or collapsed.</p>

<p>For example, if you were writing an essay you may begin by creating an
outline. Initially that would consist of the main section headings. You may
then decide to subdivide those headings further, or add explanatory text that
explains the heading's scope. As you continue this iterative process, you can
focus on a particular level by <i>expanding</i> that level of the hierarchy.
This process enables long or complex documents to be planned and organised in
a logical fashion.</p>

<h2 id="">Solution</h2>

<p>Use the <a href="http://www.vimoutliner.org/">Vim Outliner</a> plugin.</p>

<p>Vim Outliner satisfies all of the objectives above. It's completely
integrated with Vim, so your existing Vim knowledge still applies, and there's
little to learn.</p>

<p>Download the plugin from <a href="http://www.vimoutliner.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Downloads&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewdownload&amp;cid=4">VimOutliner.org</a>,
then follow the installation instructions. (The <a href="../../extending/extending-vim-with-scripts-plugins/index.html">Extending Vim with Scripts and
  Plugins</a> recipe may be helpful here).</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>Debian/Ubuntu users can install Vim Outliner via their package manager.
  The installation process is slightly convoluted, however, so instructions
  follow:</p>
  <pre><code><samp>$ </samp><kbd>sudo apt-get install vim-vimoutliner
  vim-addon-manager</kbd>
  <samp>$ </samp><kbd>sudo vim-addons -w install vimoutliner</kbd></code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Add the following line to your <a href="../../basics/configuring-vim/index.html"><tt>vimrc</tt></a> if not already there:</p>

<pre><code>filetype plugin indent on</code></pre>

<p>Now open a new file with an <tt>.otl</tt> extension with Vim, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>vim outline.otl</code></pre>

<p>Each line of this file becomes an entry in the outline. Indentation is used
to denote levels of hierarchy. For example:</p>

<img src="../../vim-outliner.png" />

<p>In this example, <i>Solar System</i> is at the top level of the outline.
<i>Sun</i> and <i>Planets</i> are the next level down. All of the planets are
in the next level after that. Each level is automatically assigned a
colour.</p>

<p>You can add body text to a heading by starting a new line with a colon
followed by a space, i.e. <tt>: Body text</tt>.</p>

<img src="../../vim-outliner-body-text.png" />

<p>In the example above, body text has been added to the <i>Sun</i>
heading.</p>

<p>Vim Outliner uses Vim's <a href="../../navigation/navigating-folds/index.html">folds</a> feature, so
the standard <i>folds</i> commands still work. Continuing the above example,
if your cursor is over the body text and you hit the fold close command
<kbd>zc</kbd> the text will be hidden.</p>

<img src="../../vim-outliner-body-text-closed.png" />

<p>Using <kbd>zc</kbd> on a heading collapses its child elements. So, with the
cursor over <i>Planets</i> <kbd>zc</kbd> displays:</p>

<img src="../../vim-outliner-heading-collapsed.png" />

<p>To expand a tree one level use <kbd>zo</kbd>; to expand it all the way down
use <kbd>zO</kbd>.</p>

<p>To move a heading to a lower level in the hierarchy use <kbd>&gt;&gt;</kbd>
in Normal mode; <kbd>&lt;&lt;</kbd> reverses the process.</p>

<p>A shortcut for expanding the hierarchy to a certain level is
<kbd>\<var>n</var></kbd>, where <var>n</var> is the minimum level you want
displayed. <kbd>\0</kbd> expands every level. <kbd>\1</kbd> collapses every
level. Using <kbd>\2</kbd> on our solar system outline displays only the
first- and second-level headings:</p>

  <p>A mature alternative to Vim Outliner is <a href="http://bike-nomad.com/vim/vimoutliner.html">TVO</a> (<i>The Vim
    Outliner</i>).  Confusingly-similar name aside, it's worth considering if
  Vim Outliner doesn't suit you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="">Discussion</h2>

<p>A key strength of this form of organisation is that you can view a complex
document <i>at a glance</i> with <kbd>\1</kbd>, then drill down to a specific
heading to work on it.</p>

<p>I use one for my todo/ideas list by putting every item on a line of its
own, then, as patterns emerge, grouping items under headings. For instance, I
may add a heading for <i>Book on
  HTML</i>. Some time later I think of some chapters, so add them as
subheadings to <i>Book on HTML</i>. When I want to start writing notes for a
chapter I add body text to a heading, and start typing.</p>

<p>Vim Outliner comes with various scripts to convert outlines into other file
formats. For instance, there is a script named <tt>otl2html</tt> which can be
used to convert a <tt>.otl</tt> file into a <tt>.html</tt>. This lets you
create semantically-correct webpages without writing HTML. There's also
<tt>otl2docbook</tt> and <tt>otl2pdb</tt>, which target <i>DocBook</i> and
<i>AddressDB Palm</i>, respectively. For more tools like this, see <a href="http://vimoutliner.org/">VimOutliner.org</a>.</p>
