<h2 id="">Problem</h2>

<p>You want to use a Vim regular expression, but don't know how they work.</p>

<p>For example, you want to search a document for a word that begins with a
vowel.</p> 

<h2 id="">Solution</h2>

<p>Vim allows you to use regular expressions (<i>regexps</i>) in many areas.
The <a href="../../searching/searching-for-any-word/index.html">Searching for Any Word</a> recipe, for
example, explains how to search a file for a regexp.</p>

<p>A regexp is a pattern that describes a string. We will use the
<tt>/<var>pattern</var>/</tt> notation for describing patterns, and the
<tt>"<i>string</i>"</tt> notation to represent the text the pattern is being tested
against.</p> 

<p>The simplest form of pattern is a literal string, which matches that exact
string. For example, <tt>/cow/</tt> matches <tt>"<i>cow</i>"</tt>,
<tt>"<i>Don't
    have a cow</i>"</tt>, and <tt>"<i>cower</i>"</tt>.</p>

<p>The period (<tt>.</tt>) has special significance in a regexp. It matches
any single character. So, <tt>/.ow/</tt> also matches <tt>"<i>cow</i>"</tt>,
but also <tt>"<i>sow</i>"</tt>, and <tt>"<i>tow</i>"</tt>.</p>

<p>You can use character ranges to indicate that any one of the specified
characters are acceptable. For example <tt>/[cs]ow/</tt> would match
<tt>"<i>cow</i>"</tt>, <tt>"<i>sow</i>"</tt>, and
<tt>"<i>undersow</i>"</tt>.</p> 

<p>If your range consists of alphabetically or numerically consecutive characters
you can specify the start character and end character separated by a hyphen.
For example, to match <tt>"<i>b</i>"</tt>, <tt>"<i>c</i>"</tt>,
<tt>"<i>d</i>"</tt>, <tt>"<i>e</i>"</tt>, or <tt>"<i>f</i>"</tt>, you can use
<tt>/[b-f]/</tt>. Or, an integer between 1 and 5: <tt>/[1-5]/</tt>.</p>

<p>You can invert character ranges so they match any character <i>not</i>
specified. For example, <tt>/[^cs]ow/</tt> matches any character that isn't a
<tt>"<i>c</i>"</tt> or an <tt>"<i>s</i>"</tt> followed by
<tt>"<i>ow</i>"</tt>, i.e.  <tt>"<i>acknowledge</i>"</tt>, <tt>"<i>I said
    "ow"!</i>"</tt>, and <tt>"<i>bellow</i>"</tt>.</p>

<p>Another useful concept of regexps is repetition. If you wanted to match strings
containing consecutive <tt>"<i>o</i>"</tt>s followed by an
<tt>"<i>i</i></tt>, like <tt>"<i>cooing</i>"</tt> and
<tt>"<i>tattooist</i>"</tt>, you could use <tt>/ooi/</tt>. If you wanted to
abstract this pattern, however, to match one or more <tt>"<i>o</i>"</tt>s
followed by an <tt>"<i>i</i>"</tt>, you'd have a problem.</p>

<p>The solution is to suffix the part of the pattern that can be repeated with
a <i>metacharacter</i> which specifies the type of repetition. A metacharacter
is simply a character that has special significance in a regular expression.
For example, the <tt>"<i>+</i>"</tt> metacharacter requires that what precedes
it<span class="fn">In fact, it requires that the <i>atom</i> that precedes it
  occurs one or more times, but this recipe is already too complex. If you
  want this level of detail see <tt>:help pattern</tt> or a regular expression
  book.</span> occurs either one or more times. For example, <tt>/o\+i/</tt>
matches one or more <tt>"<i>o</i>"</tt>s followed by an <tt>"<i>i</i>"</tt>:
<tt>"<i>abattoir</i>"</tt>, <tt>"<i>cooing</i>"</tt>, and
<tt>"<i>oii</i>"</tt>.</p>

<p>The <tt>"<i>*</i>"</tt> metacharacter represents any number of occurrences
of the preceding character, so <tt>/o*i/</tt> matches
<tt>"<i>zucchini</i>"</tt>, <tt>"<i>boating</i>"</tt>, and
<tt>"<i>zooming</i>"</tt>. This time the <tt>"<i>o</i>"</tt> is made optional.
(Given that it starts the pattern it's actually unnecessary; <tt>/i/</tt> will
match everything that it matches).</p>

<p>A more useful example is <tt>/[a-c]t*o\+i/</tt> which matches either
<tt>"<i>a</i>"</tt>, <tt>"<i>b</i>"</tt>, or <tt>"<i>c</i>"</tt> followed by
any number of <tt>"<i>t</i>"</tt>s, followed by at least one
<tt>"<i>o</i>"</tt>, followed by an <tt>"<i>i</i>"</tt>. The following words
satisfy the pattern: <tt>"<i>tattooing</i>"</tt>, <tt>"<i>coins</i>"</tt>,
and <tt>"<i>limboing</i>"</tt>.  It may not be intuitive that
<tt>"<i>tattooing</i>"</tt> would match, so let's walk through it: The
<tt>"<i>a</i>"</tt> satisfies <tt>/[a-c]/</tt>, the following two
<tt>"<i>t</i>"</tt>s match <tt>/t*/</tt>, the following two
<tt>"<i>o</i>"</tt>s match <tt>/o\+/</tt>, then the <tt>"<i>i</i>"</tt>
matches <tt>/i/</tt>.</p>

<p>A key concept to grasp here is that a string matches a regexp as long as a
contiguous portion of it matches. In the example above the regexp looks at the
first character of <tt>"<i>tattooing</i>"</tt> and tries applying the pattern
to it. This fails because <tt>"t"</tt> is not a member of the character class
<tt>[a-c]</tt>. So it moves on to the next letter and starts again, this time
it matches up to <tt>"<i>i</i>"</tt>, as explained above, and because the
pattern has now been exhausted, the rest of the string is ignored.</p>

<p>You can make a portion of the regexp optional (i.e. insisting that it
matches 0 or 1 times) with <tt>\=</tt>. You can generalise this with the
<tt>\{<var>min</var>,<var>max</var>\}</tt> notation which matches at least
<var>min</var> times, but no more than <var>max</var> times. For example,
<tt>/[^a-c][a-c]\{2,4\}[hero]/</tt> matches <tt>"<i>yachts</i>"</tt>
(<tt>"<i>yach</i>"</tt>), and <tt>"<i>blabbed</i>"</tt>
(<tt>"<i>labbe</i>"</tt>), but doesn't match <tt>"<i>cabbage</i>"</tt>.</p>

<p>Like character ranges, alternation allows you to specify a list of
alternatives that can match at a given point.  Whereas character ranges
specify sets of characters, alternation is used for sets of strings. For
example, <tt>/ing\|ed/</tt> matches the string <tt>"<i>ing</i>"</tt> or the
string <tt>"<i>ed</i>"</tt>, e.g.  <tt>"<i>simpered</i>"</tt>, and
<tt>"<i>attacking</i>"</tt>. If you used a character range here, e.g.
<tt>/[inged]/</tt>, the pattern would match any string that contained an
<tt>"<i>i</i>"</tt>, an <tt>"<i>n</i>"</tt>, a <tt>"<i>g</i>"</tt>, an
<tt>"<i>e</i>"</tt>, or a <tt>"<i>d</i>"</tt>. i.e. it would match all the
strings the alternation approach does, but also many, many more.</p>

<p>All the patterns so far have been allowed to match at any point in the
string.  That is to say, before Vim gives up on a match it will try applying
the pattern at every point in the text. You can change this behaviour by using
anchors: <tt>^</tt> matches the start of a line, while <tt>$</tt> matches the
end.  So, <tt>/^\s\=\uo/</tt> matches a line that begins with an optional
white space character, which is followed by an uppercase letter, which is
followed by an <tt>"<i>o</i>"</tt>. The following strings will all match:
<tt>"<i> Popes are
    religious</i>"</tt>, <tt>"<i>Roman</i>"</tt>, and <tt>"<i>Soviet
    Union</i>"</tt>.</p>

<p>You can combine the two anchors to require that the whole line matches the
pattern. For example, <tt>/^\uo\%(v|ma\).\+[rnt]\$/</tt> will match
<tt>"<i>Tomahawk thrown</i>"</tt>, <tt>"<i>November</i>"</tt> and
<tt>"<i>Soviet</i>"</tt>, but will reject <tt>"<i>Soviet Union</i>"</tt> or
<tt>"<i>During November</i>"</tt>.</p>

<h2 id="">Discussion</h2>

<p>The features described above are common to most regexp implementations. Vim
offers some extensions, though, that users familiar with other regexp
implementations may not be aware of.</p>

<p>By default regexps are case sensitive. That is to say <tt>/cow/</tt> will not
match <tt>"<i>Cow</i>"</tt>. You can make all patterns ignore case with <tt>:set
  ignorecase</tt>. To change the case sensitivity for a particular pattern surround
the relevant portions with <tt>\c</tt> (to ignore case from
this point on) and/or <tt>\C</tt> to respect case from this
point on. For example, <tt>/\ccow/</tt> matches <tt>"<i>cow</i>"</tt>,
<tt>"<i>coW</i>"</tt>, and <tt>"<i>Cow</i>"</tt>.  However,
<tt>/\cco\Cw/</tt> matches <tt>"<i>COw</i>"</tt> and
<tt>"<i>cow</i>"</tt>, but not <tt>"<i>COW</i>"</tt>. The <tt>\c</tt> makes
the <tt>"<i>co</i>"</tt> case insensitive, then the <tt>\C</tt> makes
the <tt>"<i>w</i>"</tt> case sensitive.</p>

<p>Some characters in a regexp have a special significance and don't match
themselves literally in the string. For example, <tt>/^foo/</tt> matches a
line starting with <tt>"<i>foo</i>"</tt>; it doesn't match
<tt>"<i>^foo</i>"</tt>. To match a special character you need to
precede it with a backslash, For example <tt>\^</tt> matches <tt>"<i>^</i>"</tt>,
<tt>\$</tt> matches <tt>"<i>$</i>"</tt>, <tt>\.</tt> matches
<tt>"<i>.</i>"</tt>, etc.</p>

<p>Of particular note in Vim is <tt>\n</tt>, which matches a newline
character, <tt>\r</tt> which matches a carriage return character. and
<tt>\t</tt> which matches a <kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd>.</p>

<p>Vim supports <i>backreferences</i> which allow you to refer to part of a match later
in the same match. For example, <tt>/\([a-z]\)\1/</tt> matches a lowercase
letter followed by the same character that just matched. This would match
<tt>"<i>zoom</i>"</tt>, and <tt>"<i>seeing</i>"</tt>. The parenthesised portion of the
pattern is a <i>group</i>, and the backreference (<tt>\<var>n</var></tt>) refers to the
<var>n</var><sup>th</sup> group. So, <tt>/\([a-z]\)\([a-z]\)\2\1/</tt> matches two lowercase
letters, followed by the second one again, then the first one again.  This
matches strings like <tt>"<i>abba</i>"</tt>.</p>
