  Formats</h1>

<h2 id="">Problem</h2>

<p>You're editing a file created on a different operating system, so need to
change its line endings. Or, you wish to convert a file to use different line
endings, perhaps because a tool expects them that way.</p>

<h2 id="">Solution</h2>

<p>Specify the desired file format with <tt>:set ff=<var>format</var></tt>,
where <var>format</var> is <i>dos</i> for Microsoft Windows/DOS files,
<i>unix</i> for Unix/Linux, or <i>mac</i> for Apple Mac. As usual, you must
then <a href="../../basics/saving-a-file/index.html">save the file</a> to make the changes permanent:
<tt>:up</tt>.</p>

<h2 id="">Discussion</h2>

<p>Different operating systems have different notions of what constitutes a
line in a text file. Specifically, they disagree on the control character that
terminates a line. Unix/Linux uses a line feed (LF), Microsoft Windows uses a
carriage return followed by a line feed (CRLF), and the Mac uses a carriage
return (CR). This would be a matter of pedantry were it not for users of
different operating systems sharing files.</p>

<p>Luckily, Vim handles this situation transparently most of the time. When a
file is loaded, its format is guessed, and <tt>&amp;ff</tt> is set
appropriately. If Vim guesses incorrectly, you can insist on a specific file
format with <tt>:e ++ff=<var>format</var></tt>, thus forcing the file to
convert to the given format.</p>

<p>The above assumes that a file's line endings are at least consistent. That
is, each line ends with the same character(s). If your file is mangled (some
lines ending with CR, some with LF, for example) you
will likely see stray control characters such as <tt>^J</tt> or <tt>^M</tt>
peppered throughout. This can be fixed with <a href="../../searching/searching-and-replacing/index.html">search and replace</a>: <tt>:%s/\r//</tt>.
Lastly, if you have some Mac line endings with <tt>dos</tt>/<tt>unix</tt> or
Unix/Linux line endings with <tt>mac</tt>, use <tt>:%s/\r/\r/g</tt>.</p>
