<h2 id="">Problem</h2>

<p>You want to define an area of text for a command to operate on without
leaving <i>Normal</i> mode.</p>

<p>For example, you want to delete next two words, or reformat the current
paragraph.</p>

<h2 id="">Solution</h2>

<p>In <i>Normal</i> and <i>Visual</i> mode operator commands can be followed
by <i>motions</i> which describe what text they should operate on. They can be
thought of as a set of directions the operator should use to select text.</p>

<p>For example, you can delete the character under the cursor with
<kbd>x</kbd>. If you wanted to delete the word <i>fandangle</i> you'd need to
press <kbd>x</kbd> nine times: once for each character. You could simplify the
process by prefixing <kbd>x</kbd> with a <a href="../../editing/repeating-commands/index.html"><i>count</i></a>: <kbd>9x</kbd>. However, that
requires you to know how many characters are in the word, and would be totally
impractical if you wanted to delete multiple words at once. Instead you can
use the <kbd>d<var>motion</var></kbd> command which deletes the text selected
by <var>motion</var>, as opposed to the character-by-character approach of
<kbd>x</kbd>. The motion for a word is <tt>w</tt>, so you can delete the word
more easily with <kbd>dw</kbd>.</p>

<p>The following table shows some common operators which understand motions.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Operator</th>    
    <th>Action</th>
    <th>Description</th>                     
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>c</kbd></td>
    <td>change</td>
    <td>Deletes then enters insert mode.</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>d</kbd></td>
    <td>delete</td>
    <td><a href="../../basics/deleting-text/index.html">Deletes</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>y</kbd></td>
    <td>yank</td>
    <td><a href="../../basics/copying-cutting-pasting/index.html">Copies</a> to a register.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>gq</kbd></td>
    <td>format</td>
    <td>Reformats.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>&gt;</kbd></td>
    <td>indent</td>
    <td><a href="../../editing/indenting-lines/index.html">Shifts text left</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>&lt;</kbd></td>
    <td>unindent</td>
    <td><a href="../../editing/indenting-lines/index.html">Shifts text right</a>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Here are some common motions:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Moves</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>h</kbd></td>
    <td>Left <var>count</var> characters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>l</kbd></td>
    <td>Right <var>count</var> characters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>j</kbd></td>
    <td>Down <var>count</var> characters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>k</kbd></td>
    <td>Up <var>count</var> characters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>$</kbd></td>
    <td>To end of the line.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>$</kbd></td>
    <td>To end of the line <var>count</var>-1 lines downward.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>0</kbd></td>
    <td>To the first character of the line.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>f<var>char</var></kbd></td>
    <td>To the <var>count</var><sup>th</sup> occurrence of <var>char</var> to the right.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>We can combine operators and motions to select text then operate upon it.
Let's look at some examples:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><kbd>y10h</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Copy the previous 10 characters to a register.</dd>
  <dt><kbd>d$</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Delete from the current character until the end of the line.</dd>
  <dt><kbd>c2j</kbd></dt>
  <dd>Delete the current line and the one below it, then enter Insert mode.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="">Discussion</h2>

<p>Motions aren't very intelligent. Say you wanted to delete the word
<i>This</i> with <kbd>dw</kbd>. That works as long as your cursor is over
<i>T</i>; if you were on the <i>h</i>, you'd only delete that.</p>

<p>Vim supports additional motions for operating on text objects.  One of
these is <kbd>aw</kbd> (mnemonic: <em>a</em> <em>w</em>ord) which would do the
right thing in both examples above because it considers what <em>object</em>,
not character, the cursor over.</p>

<p><i>Text object</i> commands are very similar to motions, and can be used
with the same operators. They're frequently just a motion command prefixed
with either <i>a</i> or <i>i</i>. The <i>a</i> prefix indicates that the whole
object will be selected, including white space; the <i>i</i> prefix selects
the <i>inner</i> object without white space, or just the white space. A few of
the available commands follow:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Selects</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>aw</kbd></td>
    <td rowspan="2"><var>count</var> words</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>iw</kbd></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>aW</kbd></td>
    <td rowspan="2"><var>count</var> non-blank characters</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>iW</kbd></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>as</kbd></td>
    <td rowspan="2"><var>count</var> sentences</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>is</kbd></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>aB</kbd></td>
    <td rowspan="2"><var>count</var> [&#x2026;] or {&#x2026;} blocks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>iB</kbd></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>a"</kbd></td>
    <td rowspan="2"><var>count</var> quoted strings</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd><var>count</var>i"</kbd></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>So, to delete a paragraph, position your cursor anywhere inside it then hit
<kbd>dap</kbd>. <em>D</em>elete <em>a</em> <em>p</em>aragraph - it even sounds
sensible<span class="fn">No, this is not a bug.</span>.</p>

<p>A motion can also be a regular expression, in which case it describes the
text matched: extending from the current cursor position to the penultimate
character matched by the pattern. The syntax is
<kbd>/<var>pattern</var></kbd>: a solidus followed by a regular
expression. For example, <kbd>d/\d</kbd> deletes from the current character to
the first digit, excluding the digit itself.
