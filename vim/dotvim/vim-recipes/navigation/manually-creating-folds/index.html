<h2 id="">Problem</h2>

<p>You want to <i>fold</i> a file, then navigate it in <i>outline</i> mode.</p>

<h2 id="">Solution</h2>

<blockquote class="callout">

  <h3 id="">Enabling Folding</h3>

  <p>Folding is very likely already enabled in your Vim. If not,
  check it has been compiled with the <i>+folding</i> option,
  and that <tt>foldenable</tt> is true, i.e. <tt>:set foldenable</tt>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Use Vim's <i>folding</i> feature to treat a file hierarchically,
expanding and collapsing its sections as necessary.</p>

<p>Fold commands start with <i>z</i>. Vim's help makes the spurious case
that this, kinda', if you squint, looks like a <i>fold</i>ed piece of
paper.</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Command</th> <th>Action</th></tr>
  <tr><td><kbd>zf</kbd></td> <td>Fold the selected text.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><kbd>zf<var>#</var>j</kbd></td> <td>Create a fold from the cursor
      down <var>#</var> lines.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><kbd>zf/<var>string</var></kbd></td> <td>Create a fold from the
      cursor to <var>string</var>.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><kbd>zfa<var>B</var></kbd></td>
    <td>Fold the current block delimited by bracket <var>B</var><span class="fn"><var>B</var> can be any of <tt>()[]{}&lt;&gt;</tt>. This feature 
    understands nested blocks, too, so will usually do 
    the right thing.</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>For instance, <kbd>zf4j</kbd> creates a fold from the current line to the
forth line down. Or, if you've <a href="../../basics/visually-selecting-text/index.html">selected
  text in
  Visual mode</a>, then <kbd>zf</kbd> will fold the selection.</p>

<h2 id="">Discussion</h2>

<p>How you use folds will depend very much on the type of file you are
editing.  They are particularly useful for long papers or essays, for
instance, where you fold each section so as to navigate the document
hierarchically. When editing program source code they can be used with
function/method/class declarations.</p>

<p>This recipe is entitled <i>Manually</i> Creating Folds, because there are
other approaches to folding which are automatic. A particularly useful method,
indentation folding, is described below. In addition, most programming
languages support <i>syntax</i> folding. Try it out by opening some source
code in Vim then executing <tt>:set foldmethod=syntax</tt>.</p>

<blockquote class="callout">

  <h3 id="indentation-folding">Indentation Folding</h3>

  <p>If you're working with structured, indented text you may prefer to use
  indentation folding.</p> 

  <p>Enable it with <tt>:set foldmethod=indent</tt>. Folds are now
  automatically created for each level of indented text. (To indent simply
  start a line with a <kbd>&lt;Tab&gt;</kbd><span class="fn">Each
    <tt>shiftwidth</tt> of indent corresponds to one fold. See the <a href="../../editing/indenting-lines/index.html">Indenting Lines</a> recipe for
    details.</span> So, for example, <kbd>zM</kbd> folds all indented
  text.</p>
